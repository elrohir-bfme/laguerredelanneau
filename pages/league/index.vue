        Info & Rules üßô<br/> <br/>

        The League will be played on the new beta patch up until its public release, only league players will have access to it in 202-beta-testing 
        <br/>The League is based on an ELO point system.
        <br/>Players can play against anyone regardless of their ELO placement. However, the larger the point/skill gap between players the more punishing it becomes for higher skilled players who lose, and vice versa.
        <br/>Each Replay must be posted in the dedicated league-replays 

        <br/><br/>To upload a replay simply use the command: "/replay" in league replays channel and write the correct information. 

        <br/><br/>Players must approve the replay for it to be uploaded as well as league admins with a ‚úÖ under the replay's message in league-replays :warning: 

        <br/><br/>If a game is played on a map that is not in the map pool, the replay will not be counted ‚ö†Ô∏è 

        <br/><br/>If any type of disconnection/oos :DC: happens, the game can be replayed if both players agree. If they disagree the replay can be reviewed and see if there was a clear winner, if there is no clear winner the person who dced will get the loss as any other type of ladder in other successful RTSes.

        <br/>"Farming" points is forbidden and will be sanctioned. Do not hesitate to challenge players and discuss in the league-discussion 

        <br/>Remember ! No matter your skill level you are welcome to come compete in the league and face down other players players of your skill level or higher ! Learn and improve in a fun ladder experience with cool features ! üìØ

        Rules  ‚òÑÔ∏è

        <br/><br/>- Starting resources: 1000
        <br/>- üë• Command Point: X1
        <br/>- Custom Hero: Disabled ‚ùå 
        <br/>- Ring: Optional
        <br/>- üîé Neutral Host: Mandatory unless both players agree to play one on host game each. 
        <br/>- üîÉ In case of any problems please contact the league managers
        <br/>- üé≤ Factions: Free to select whichever faction or randomise 
        <br/>- üé≤ Optionnal Rule (not mandatory and at the discretion of the players) ‚¨áÔ∏è

        <br/><br/>If both players agree, choosing factions can be done so: Both players inform their neutral host of their faction of choice. The host then reveals the factions each player chose and they must then stick to their choice, preventing "counter picking". This rule is strictly optional. 

        <br/><br/>NETWORK 

        <br/>Both GameRanger and Radmin can be used to play games, although Radmin is recommended as it is more reliable and stable (less lag) than GameRanger. If you do not know what Radmin is, it is a small and similar app like GameRanger. You may download it and join our network to play!
